# React native OBS control

This application connects to a computer running OBS with the [obs-websocket plugin](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket)

## Purpose

I made this app because I wanted a quicker way of seeing my recording status, along with a simple way to control my recordings without opening up a remote desktop session from my phone, which was slow.

I also made this app as a part of a video series, if I remember I'll link the videos in this readme at a future date

## Running this code

It's react native, so follow the instructions [in the react native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#running-your-react-native-application)

## Contributing/Feature Requests

Feel free to ask for anything you'd like, this was an hour project so don't have high expectations please!

Please do not sell this application, if you would like to inquire about doing so my email is noted on my profile.
